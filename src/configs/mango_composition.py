Mango composition dataset (Mendeley b9d6s7hr33) — Vitamin C + acidity + sugar.

186 intact mangoes across 4 cultivars (Kent, Palmer, Kweni, Cengkir), each
with three measured composition attributes: Vitamin C (mg/100g), titratable
acidity TA (mg/100g), and soluble solids SSC (degrees Brix). (The source file
also has ~1,500 NIR bands, not used here.)

Honest scope: only 3 features, and they're near-independent (|r| < 0.2), so the
correlation comparison isn't discriminative and there's no mechanistic causal
graph (CAUSAL_GRAPH empty). The value is the leave-one-CULTIVAR-out transfer:
generate an unseen mango cultivar's Vit C / acid / sugar profile from an
ensemble trained on the others, and check fidelity + uncertainty near vs far.
All four cultivars have >=18 samples, so all can be held out.

Run: make run CONFIG=mango_composition    (comparison + calibration)
     make loro CONFIG=mango_composition   (leave-one-cultivar-out transfer)
