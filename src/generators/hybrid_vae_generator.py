    """
    A hybrid physics-informed VAE: the same generative model as the plain
    VAE, plus a physics-consistency loss that injects the caller-supplied
    causal graph directly into training. This is the bridge between the two
    other engines — it keeps the VAE's fully data-driven strengths (a learned
    latent joint, novel-individual sampling, no handcrafted marginals) while
    borrowing the physics-informed Monte Carlo generator's one piece of real
    domain knowledge: the fitted linear-Gaussian relationship on each causal
    edge.

    Each (parent, child) edge in `causal_graph` is fit once on the real data
    (slope, intercept, residual variance — the identical conditionals the
    physics-MC generator samples). Those constants become a differentiable
    penalty (see `_physics_loss`) added to the loss, weighted by
    `physics_weight`, that pushes every reconstructed batch onto the
    mechanistic relationships while matching their real residual spread — so
    the constraint guides the generative manifold toward physically
    consistent samples without re-introducing the VAE's variance-shrinkage
    tendency.

    Everything else matches the plain VAE. Trains on `x` (expected already
    reasonably scaled) and samples `n_samples` rows from the prior; pass a
    fitted `scaler` only if `x` needs inverse-transforming back to source
    units. Loss is the standard VAE ELBO (reconstruction MSE + analytic KL to
    the standard-normal prior, `beta` linearly annealed from 0 over the first
    `kl_warmup_frac` of training to avoid posterior collapse), plus the
    covariance-matching term (`cov_weight`) that rewards preserving the full
    correlation matrix, plus the physics term (`physics_weight`) that rewards
    honoring the causal graph specifically. `cov_weight` shapes the whole
    covariance structure from data; `physics_weight` anchors the particular
    mechanistic edges an expert asserts — set `physics_weight=0.0` to recover
    the plain VAE exactly.

    A fourth term, weighted by `marginal_weight`, is the per-feature 1D
    Wasserstein distance (see `_marginal_loss`) between samples drawn from the
    prior and the real batch. The physics term only constrains parent->child
    edges, leaving the causal graph's *root* variables free to be compressed
    by the VAE — the main reason marginal fit otherwise trails physics-MC,
    which samples roots straight from their real marginal. This term shapes
    every generated feature's whole distribution onto real, roots included;
    set `marginal_weight=0.0` to disable it.

    `prior_type` chooses how latents are drawn at generation (and for the
    generated-sample loss terms): "standard" samples the N(0, I) prior;
    "aggregate" samples the aggregate posterior over the training rows (see
    `_decode_samples`), which keeps samples on the region of latent space the
    decoder actually learned and avoids the prior-hole mismatch that inflates
    both KS and correlation error when the aggregate posterior doesn't fill
    the prior.

    `constrain_generated` routes the covariance and physics terms onto a batch
    of freshly generated rows instead of the reconstructions — so those
    constraints shape the population that's actually sampled at generation,
    not just the model's reconstruction of real inputs. The default (False)
    keeps them on reconstructions, matching the plain VAE's covariance-term
    convention.

    `calibrate_marginals` applies an empirical-copula post-step (see
    `_calibrate_marginals`): after generation, each feature is mapped onto the
    real training marginal at matching quantiles, forcing every marginal to
    match real almost exactly while preserving the learned rank-correlation
    structure. It injects the real empirical margins (like physics-MC does for
    its roots), so a run using it should be described as marginal-calibrated
    rather than purely learned. Default False.

    `use_minibatch`, `batch_size`, `patience`, `hidden_dim`, `dropout`, and
    `free_bits` behave exactly as in the plain VAE generator — see its
    docstring for the capacity/collapse/early-stopping trade-offs; the causal
    constraint doesn't change any of them.
