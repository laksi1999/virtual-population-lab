    Generates synthetic rows via forward Monte Carlo sampling over a
    caller-supplied causal graph:

    - Each variable in `root_variables` is drawn from its own real marginal
      distribution (assumed Gaussian).
    - Each (parent, child) edge in `causal_graph` draws `child` from a
      linear relationship fit on the real data, plus residual noise sampled
      at that fit's real residual std.

    Every conditional here is a Gaussian we can sample directly, so plain
    ancestral Monte Carlo sampling (this function) is exact — there's no
    intractable distribution to approximate, so no need for MCMC.

    The causal structure and roots are dataset knowledge supplied by the
    caller (see src/configs/apple_quality.py) — this function has no
    dataset-specific assumptions baked in, so it works unchanged for a
    different set of features/relationships.
