"""
Conditional VAE (CVAE) — a generative engine that conditions on a covariate
(e.g. growing region) so it can generate a population *for a specified
condition value*, including a value it never saw in training (extrapolation).
The unconditional engines can't do this; it's the capability the
leave-one-group-out transfer experiment (src.evaluation.loro) is built on.

Both encoder and decoder take the one-hot condition alongside their input, so
the decoder can be driven to a chosen condition at generation time.
