"""
Same-model near/far transfer evaluation ("leave-one-group-out" by name, but the
clean same-model design).

Tests the capability that distinguishes a generative virtual-population model
from a descriptive comparison: can it generate a realistic population for a
condition it saw little/none of, and does its uncertainty widen when it does?

For each group big enough to hold part of it out (a "train region"):

  1. Train ONE conditional-VAE ensemble on a train split of that region only.
  2. NEAR (interpolation): generate that region's condition, score against the
     region's *held-out same-region* rows. Unseen individuals, seen condition.
  3. FAR  (extrapolation): with the SAME ensemble, generate each *other* region's
     condition and score against that region's real rows. Unseen condition.

Because NEAR and FAR come from the *same* trained models (only the queried
condition changes), the disagreement difference isolates the unseen-condition
effect — unlike the older train-all-vs-train-all-but-one design, whose NEAR and
FAR used different training sets and gave a noisy signal. Reported per train
region plus a MEAN row; the headline is FAR-vs-NEAR ensemble disagreement.

Metrics vs the scored real rows: correlation distance + mean KS (fidelity),
coverage@90 (do the intervals still cover real?), and ensemble disagreement
(spread across members' per-feature means, per-global-std = epistemic
uncertainty; expect FAR > NEAR).
