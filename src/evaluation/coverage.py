"""
Uncertainty calibration via coverage.

The project's hypothesis is that a good generator produces *calibrated
uncertainty*, not just realistic point values — but the correlation/KS metrics
don't test that. This does: for each feature, take the generated population's
central interval at a nominal level (e.g. the 5th-95th percentile for 90%) and
measure what fraction of the REAL held-out values actually fall inside. A
well-calibrated generator covers real values at the nominal rate; one whose
spread is too narrow (over-confident) under-covers, one too wide over-covers.

This is a *marginal* (per-feature) calibration check — it works identically for
every engine because they all produce a population. Conditional coverage
(intervals that widen out-of-support) needs conditional generation and is left
for the transfer experiments.
